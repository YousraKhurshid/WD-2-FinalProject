Project Overview We are working on an E-commerce website using React. Our project involves creating four interfaces: User, Guest, Vendor, and Admin. Each interface will have specific functionalities tailored to its role within the system.

Technologies Used React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Firebase: Cloud-based platform for backend services, including authentication and storage. React Hooks: Used for managing state and side effects in functional components. DummyJSON: Used to generate fake API data for testing and development purposes. Functionality User Interface: Allows registered users to browse products, add items to cart, and complete purchases. Guest Interface: Provides limited access to browsing products. Guests can add items to cart but cannot complete purchases without registering. Vendor Interface: Enables vendors to manage their product listings, view orders, and update inventory. Admin Interface: Grants administrative privileges for managing users, products, and orders. Features Implemented Authentication: Users can sign up and log in using email and password authentication provided by Firebase. Product Management: Vendors can add, edit, and delete product listings. Shopping Cart: Users can add items to their cart, update quantities, and remove items before checkout. Fetching Data: Utilized React hooks to fetch product data from a fake API generated using DummyJSON. Responsive Design: Ensured the website is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes. Getting Started Clone the repository to your local machine. Install dependencies using npm install. Set up Firebase project and configure Firebase authentication and storage. Run the project using npm start. Project Structure src: Contains source code files for the project. components: Reusable React components. pages: Top-level components representing different pages of the website. hooks: Custom React hooks for managing state and side effects. services: Firebase services for authentication and data storage. public: Static assets and HTML file.
